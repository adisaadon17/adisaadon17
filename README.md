### 📂 Projects

**🏁 F1 Pit-Stop Strategy Analysis**

This is my first hands-on data project. As a student, I wanted to go beyond theory and experience working with real-world data from **Kaggle**.
* **What I did:** I mainly used **SQL** to query and organize the data, and **Power BI** to build interactive dashboards. I also added a bit of **Python** for specific statistical checks.
* **Goal:** To practice the full process of data analysis - from raw data to visual insights.
